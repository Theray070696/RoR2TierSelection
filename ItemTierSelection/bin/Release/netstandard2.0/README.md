Since people in the discord loved the other mod I made, I decided to make a better version.

This mod allows you to set the tier of any non-equipment item in the game. Want Chronobauble to be a white? Go ahead! Want to make every run a broken run? Set 57 Leaf to tier 1, and have a blast! Think Red Whip shouldn't exist (don't see why, it's the best item in the game Kappa)? Have at it!

There is one thing that I'll mention here that isn't mentioned in the config. You might notice that boss items are set to 5 by default in the config. This value only works on boss items, and leaves them as boss items. I didn't allow setting normal items to boss items because I don't know how the game will handle it.
